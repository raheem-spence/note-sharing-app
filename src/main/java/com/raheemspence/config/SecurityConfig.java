/*
    Why do we need SecurityConfig?

    Without Spring Security, every endpoint is automatically public meaning it is accessible without authentication or
    logging in
     - NOTE: public DOESNT mean no security exists, no backend checks or server logic, it only means no authentication
     is required to access the endpoint

     With Spring Security, every endpoint is treated as protected by default unless you explicitly allow it.
     A protected request means Spring will not let the request reach the controller unless the user is authenticated
     - protected = access control is enforced
     - protected does not mean encrypted or hidden it just means you must be logged in (authenticated) to access it

    This annotation basically means this class contains Spring configuration (setup instructions)
    IMPORTANT: this class is NOT business logic

    @Configuration tells Spring "this class contains bean definitions (setup instructions) that you should load at
    startup"

    bean = an object managed by Spring's container (Spring creates it, stores it, injects it where needed)

    Takeaway:  This annotation marks a class as a source of bean definitions. Spring processes it at startup and uses it
    to build and manage objects inside the application context, ensuring consistent lifecycle and dependency management

/*
    This means "turn on Spring Security's web security system for this application"
    - turn on here means start applying security filters to HTTP requests because when Spring Boot starts, by defualt
    the Spring Security classes exist but they are not actively enforcing rules unless enabled/configured.

    This annotation triggers Spring to enable the following:
    1. Create a Security Filter Chain - pipeline that every HTTP request passes through
    request -> security filters -> controller

    2. Intercept ALL HTTP requests
    before the controller runs, Spring inserts itself in the middle:

    client request
          |
    spring security filters (ACTIVE NOW_
          |
    your controller

    3. Activate authentication logic
    it enables things like:
        - login processing
        - session checking
        - authorization rules

    Simple analogy:
    w/o @EnableWebSecurity --> security system installed but turned OFF

    w/ @EnableWebSecurity --> security system is ON and actively checking every door

        builder basically designing the security system blueprint. Everything before this line is configuration(instructions)

        This is what happens when it is called, Spring does 4 things:
        1. Reads your configuration(instructions):
            - Looks at everything you set -- csrf enabled, formLogin enabled, httpBasic enabled (if present), authorize rules
            So it now has the full "security blueprint"
        2. Creates security filters
            - Spring converts your config into real objects like:
                - CSRF filter
                - Authentication Filter (form login or basic auth)
                - Authorization filter
                - Session management filter
            These are real Java objects
        3. Orders them into a pipeline:
            - Spring arranges them in a specific order:
            Request ->
                CSRF Filter ->
                Authentication Filter ->
                Authorization Filter ->
                Controller
            This ordered structure is the "chain"
        4. Wraps everything into a SecurityFilterChain object
            - Now Spring creates: SecurityFilterChain (final object) which contains the full ordered list of filters
        5. That object is returned from your method
            - because of @Bean Spring stores it in the ApplicationContext

        Before build()
            You are designing a security system blueprint
        After build()
            The actual security system is installed and active
