     IMPORTANT: This class has a connection to a User NOT this class stores a User

     Relationship fields(User creator, List<Class> creatorClasses, etc.) model connections between entities rather than
     simple column values. Hibernate uses these fields plus annotations like @JoinColumn to translate fks into navigable
     Java objects
